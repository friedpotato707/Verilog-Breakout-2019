# breakout# Verilog-Breakout-2019

- Low-level implementation of the 'Breakout' videogame developed for 'Computer Organization' (Computer Architecture) class to demonstrate my knowledge.

- Received A+ for this project.

- This project was built for FPGA board (semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects, source: https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/what-is-an-fpga.html).

- FPGA board was used to design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICS) for 'Breakout'.

- The game contains 8 different levels.
